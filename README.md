# Work Schedule

## Description 

The aim of this project was to modify starter code to create a calendar application that runs in the browser. 

## Usage 

When the application is opened, the user will see the current date as well as time slots in which to save tasks. 

The CSS dynamically updates as the current time changes: the text area color changes to grey for the past, red for the present and green for the future. 

When the user saves a task in each of the time slots, the task is saved to the local storage. The tasks will stay saved to the time slots when the page is refreshed.
